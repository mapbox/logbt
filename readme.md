logbt
-----
Simple wrapper for running a backtrace when a program segfaults. Requires `gdb` on linux and `lldb` on OS X.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mapbox/logbt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mapbox/logbt)

### Install

```sh
curl -sL https://github.com/mapbox/logbt/archive/v1.2.1.tar.gz | tar --gunzip --extract --strip-components=1 --exclude=readme.md --directory=/usr/local
```

### Supports

 - Linux and OS X
 - Running as root or as unprivileged user

When running as root the corefile location will be modified by `logbt` when run.

When running as an unprivileged user logbt will not modify the corefile location and instead will only assert that it looks acceptable.

On OSX this means:

 - The system default is unmodified such that `$(sysctl -n kern.corefile) == '/cores/core.%P'`

On Linux this means:

 - The `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern` file has been modified by root like:

 ```
 sudo bash -c "echo '/tmp/logbt-coredumps/core.%p' > /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern"
 ```

### Our usage

We use this from within Docker containers to get a backtrace and dump it to `stdout`. Requires the `privileged` parameter to be set to `true` within [container definition](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html#container_definition_security).


Before (linux):

```sh
$ node segfault.js
running custom-node
going to crash custom-node
Segmentation fault
```

After (linux):

```sh
$ sudo ./bin/logbt node segfault.js
Setting /tmp/logbt-coredumps/core.%p -> /tmp/logbt-coredumps/core.%p
